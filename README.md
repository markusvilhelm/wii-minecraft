DON'T USE THIS UNLESS YOU WANT REALLY OLD CODE!

Since 3.11 kernel, Most Wii devices have been available, so cwiid is unnecessary. Can just use the Balance board as a joystick device, following standard blueman configuration. Code and updated instructions moved into main minecraft repository:

https://github.com/tommybobbins/minecraft_flashcards/tree/master/scripts/wii_balance_board

https://github.com/tommybobbins/minecraft_flashcards/tree/master/scripts/wii_balance_board/README.md

Code has been left here as a reference, but please don't use cwiid.
